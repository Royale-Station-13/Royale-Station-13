  - rscadd: Added the Syndicate Surgery Implant to the traitor uplinks of doctors,
      paramedics, roboticists, and brig physicians for 12 TC. It grants the user perfect
      surgery knowledge, allowing them to do almost any surgery, anywhere, quickly
      and free of mistakes. It is however, NOT available to either nuclear operatives
      or incursion members.
