changes:
  - rscadd: New foodtype, GORE. Split from GROSS, GORE foodtype will be replacing
      it where the food in particular resembles a corpse or organ. GROSS should only
      apply to inedible or rotting foods.
  - balance: All butchered player species are considered to be gore, only preferred
      by Lizards, Felinids, and Flies. If you like the taste of your fellow crew,
      prepare accordingly.
  - balance: Moved food preferences around to make more sense with the current system.
      Nothing drastic, but species liked foods should be much more immersive in general.
