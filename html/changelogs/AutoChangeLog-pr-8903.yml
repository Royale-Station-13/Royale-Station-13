changes:
  - rscadd: Added upgraded blood filtering surgeries! These are obtained through the
      same research as its wound-tending counterparts, and work faster while also
      removing toxin damage.
  - balance: Very slightly reduced the amount of reagents that blood filtering purges
      (by around 2%), to compensate for the increased speed offered by the upgraded
      surgeries.
