changes:
  - balance: Hierophant club now does reduced damage when the player using it isn't
      on lavaland.
  - balance: Hierophant club chasers are now fired alongside cardinal blasts when
      off of cooldown, instead of replacing them. They will also begin travel from
      the center of the blast instead of from the user making them much more useful
      in combat.
  - tweak: Hierophant chasers from all sources will no longer detonate gibtonite,
      instead defusing it in its weakest form.
  - bugfix: Resonators are no longer forgotten and have had their damage halved just
      like most of the other lavaland tools. They're no longer capable of rapidly
      dealing more damage than backstabbing with crushers.
