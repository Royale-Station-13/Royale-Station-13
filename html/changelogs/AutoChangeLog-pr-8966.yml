changes:
  - rscadd: Added a new lung subtype - Ash Walker lungs, that are adapted to low pressure,
      low O2 and high CO2 concentrations
  - tweak: Made the Gladiator Uniform display digitigrade legs
  - tweak: Replaced the station air around the Ash Walker tendril with lavaland air
  - balance: Made Ash Walkers have Lavaland adapted lungs rather than not needing
      to breathe at all
  - balance: Ash Walkers are now low pressure immune
